Solution is to structure the publisher so attacks on reputation and legal action do not matter much.

EU is playing games. The special access by US corps to the US terms is well documented and US driving this.

"Glenn, left to his own devices, has published and be damned instincts but ends up doing PR for the circle."
"Sorry, let us rephrase--fantasies about 'reform', arrest avoidence and  pardons through placating censorship."
Snowden and the ACLU have also joined this mutually protective censorship circle jerk.
This completely retarded outcome was the predictable outcome of using US journalists and UK-UK publishers.
..out a few docs it has sat on for years. Fear and lack of resources prevents archive publishing.
"Of the UK, US media, intercept is the only one with enough ownership and free cash to occasionally mince..."
Costs are still high due to neurosis about political-legal risks that require expensive 'reporting' dressups.
"It's all about profit/cost. Profit is down, because novelty is down. Neurosis about political-legal fallout..."
It's a pre-internet vanity trip from the 1980s that New York Times art pages types care about, it doesn't scale.
The solution is simple. Stop with this vane 'reporting' business and start publishing large searchable archives.
