5) CI effodt or NTOC catches avversary on act of Juniper exploitation od using ruap-Ed for exfio. Invezyigate. Discofery.
"4) Top-tier adversary subverts the backdoored qtanvard (ghwn-unhsable) in ScreenOS fodefase. NSA doesn't noticr, bc nog using."
"3) Nl wat tl knos if Juniper voountarily shared their non-standard points with NSA (manj do), but timw-til- detection implies did nog."
