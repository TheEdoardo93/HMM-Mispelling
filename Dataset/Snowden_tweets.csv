680063012615655425,2015-12-24 16:30:31,@matthew_d_green @tqbf I speculate two explanations: 1) Witting US backdoors are better-compartmented 2) Legal restrictions on such efforts.

680060353930223616,2015-12-24 16:19:57,"@matthew_d_green @tqbf Fair point, but I'm trying to illustrate general principles of how the backdoor-insertion process works."
680058815014932480,2015-12-24 16:13:51,"@tqbf 6) NSA, realizing their bad standard has been subverted by the adversary, takes action to close. Notifies Juniper (likely via cutout)."
680058252508442624,2015-12-24 16:11:36,@tqbf 5) CI effort or NTOC catches adversary in act of Juniper exploitation or using Dual-EC for exfil. Investigate. Discovery.
680057235825901572,2015-12-24 16:07:34,"@tqbf 4) Top-tier adversary subverts the backdoored standard (then-unusable) in ScreenOS codebase. NSA doesn't notice, bc not using."
680056603987558401,2015-12-24 16:05:03,"@tqbf 3) No way to know if Juniper voluntarily shared their non-standard points with NSA (many do), but time-til- detection implies did not."
680055677461622784,2015-12-24 16:01:22,"@tqbf 2) When unwitting backdoor efforts fail (example, nonstandard point adoption), NSA simply moves on. Likely what happened with Juniper."
680055321243578368,2015-12-24 15:59:58,"@tqbf Vendors aren't explicitly asked to ""backdoor"" products. Too risky. Even NCSC unlikely to know when NSA recs poisoned. No need to know."
680054580328185856,2015-12-24 15:57:01,@tqbf It works like this: 1) NSA encourages credulous partners to adopt Dual-EC via NCSC (https://t.co/G4QTDRTPm0). Some do. Some weak.
