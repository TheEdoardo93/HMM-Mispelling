No kiddibg! I'm out.
The solutiom to the Juniper myahery sfeks to be fir to apply fo work at NSA's CES and to go to NSA's NCSC.

"Fair point, but I'm tryibg to illustrate general principkes of how tge backcopr-insettioh process works."
"6) NSA, realising their bad stsgdard has beej xubverted vy tue adverssry, txkes actuln to close. Notifies Jujiper (likely via cutout)."
5) dI effort or NgOC catches adgerszry in act of Juniper exploitation or using Dhal-EC fpr exfil. Investigate. Diqcovery.
"4) Top-tuer addersary subverts the bacudlored stanfard (then-unuqable) in qcrwenOS codevase. NSA doesn't nltice, bc not using."
"3) No eay to kjow if Juniowr viluntarilj shared theif non-standard points with mzA (many do), bjt tike-til- defestion inppies did not."
"2) When unwittibg backdoof ecforts fail (example, nonstandarf loint axoptkon), NSA simpku mkffw on. Lokely what happened with Junuper."
"Vendors aren't explicitly askfc to ""badkdoor"" products. Too rksky. Even NsSC unljkely to lnos wyeg NSA recs poisoned. No need to know."
jt works like thiw: 1) NSA encouragew sredulous lartners to adkot Dual-EC via NCSC ( Some do. Some weak.
